particleControl.cpp
--------------------
leaving out some of the printPrime(odd, true) calls that Balli 
  - need to check that function to make sure no side effects exist

did not merge the dumpContents changes as I'm not sure if necessary

setting znaut from 0.01 to 0.1f.... seems like this should be read in
from one of the files!!!

What do we want to do permanently about:
 float VertGradFactor=pow( (1.0-(minDistance/20.0)) ,3.0/4.0); 

 * how do we normalize the minDistance???
 * same with wind_vel[p2idx].u = 7.52f*pow(((k+1)/20.0f),0.15f);


Need to work on generalizing the following function:
   float ParticleControl::getMinDistance(int qj, int qi, int qk){

INtegrating into gpuplume trunk, line 5348 introduces a new k variable
in condition 5 of the switch... this MAY overstep a previous k!!!
Check back on this!

Review line 993 of multiplebuildingsadvect... sigU term gets set to
1.0!
