floder "1" has c++ syntax of fortran turbulence and rotation subroutines. They are not working as they variables need to seen by each other like in fortran.
"TestCase" folder will improve the code as we can make one to one comparison. QU is not working as its in fortran95, therefore i am using exe sent by Eric to run the QU.
