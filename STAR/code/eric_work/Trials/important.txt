floder "1" has c++ syntax of fortran turbulence and rotation subroutines. They are not working as the variables need to seen by each other like in fortran. The
"TestCase" folder will improve the code as we can make one to one comparison. QU is not working as its in fortran95, therefore i am using exe sent by Eric to run the QU called QU_Exe.

Folder TestCase:
BLFlow - folder with simple boundary layer flow
QUIC - FORTRAN code with the boundary layer test case 
GPU  - has FORTRAN converted to C++ code

See also README_turbmod.txt in GPU folder
