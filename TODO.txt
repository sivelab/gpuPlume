For Michele

color by age of particle
         total distance particles have traveled
	 individual velocity components
	 dot product of wind vector with velocity
	 vector magnitude
	 
	 color by localized concentration values - particle isosurface

	 visualize heat and energy equation values
	 	   surface temperatures
		   air temperatures
		   correlations between air and surfaces

	 VR space - magic lenses for viewing

	 invisible buildings/structures
