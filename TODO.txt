* Check emitter state to make sure correct number of particles is
   being emitted.  --> 
* Get libsivelab reading in 5.51 files as well as 5.72 file sets

Add in time varying flow field/temperature changes.
    --> equilibrium/steady state

Start/stop time for solar day.

Get bugs info on dx, dy, dz resolution.
    --> check and fix for bugs

For Michele

color by age of particle
         total distance particles have traveled
	 individual velocity components
	 dot product of wind vector with velocity
	 vector magnitude
	 
	 color by localized concentration values - particle isosurface

	 visualize heat and energy equation values
	 	   surface temperatures
		   air temperatures
		   correlations between air and surfaces

	 VR space - magic lenses for viewing

	 invisible buildings/structures
